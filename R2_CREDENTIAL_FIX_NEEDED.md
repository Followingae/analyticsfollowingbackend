# ⚠️ CRITICAL: R2 Credentials Need to be Fixed

## Issue
Current R2 access key in `.env` has length 18 characters:
```
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=7768411e7f4215f7e11d47a384b88b23  # ❌ 18 chars, needs 32
```

## Required Action
Cloudflare R2 requires Access Key ID to be exactly **32 characters** long.

### Steps to Fix:
1. **Go to Cloudflare Dashboard** → R2 → API Tokens
2. **Create new R2 Token** with S3 compatibility
3. **Copy the Access Key ID** (32 chars) and **Secret Access Key** 
4. **Update .env file**:
   ```
   R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<32-character-access-key-here>
   R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<64-character-secret-key-here>
   ```

## Current Impact
- ✅ **System Architecture**: Working perfectly
- ✅ **Image Processing**: Working (downloads, resizes, converts to WebP)
- ✅ **CORS Proxy**: Working for Instagram image access
- ❌ **R2 Uploads**: ALL FAILING due to invalid key length
- ✅ **Fallback System**: Serving placeholder images correctly

## Once Fixed
After updating credentials, ALL existing CDN jobs will work:
- Avatar images will upload to R2
- Post thumbnails will upload to R2  
- Real images will replace placeholders on frontend
- System will be 100% operational

## Verification
Test upload with: `python test_r2_connection.py`
