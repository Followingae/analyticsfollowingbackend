# Shaq Profile Image CORS Issue - Diagnosis & Solution

## üîç Root Cause Found

**Problem**: The `robust_storage.py` file was storing **direct Instagram URLs** instead of proxied URLs.

**Impact**: Any profiles searched before the fix (including shaq) have non-proxied URLs in the database.

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `robust_storage.py`
- Added `proxy_instagram_url()` function
- Updated profile storage to proxy `profile_pic_url` and `profile_pic_url_hd`
- All new profiles will now have proxied URLs

### 2. Fixed `cleaned_routes.py` 
- Updated API response to use stored profile URLs instead of raw Decodo data

### 3. Fixed `comprehensive_service.py`
- Post images and thumbnails already had proxying
- Profile images already had proxying (but weren't being used)

## üéØ Solution for Shaq Profile

The shaq profile was cached with old non-proxied URLs. To fix this:

### Option 1: Force Refresh (Recommended)
```bash
POST /instagram/profile/shaq/refresh
```
This will:
- Bypass database cache
- Fetch fresh data from Decodo
- Store with proxied URLs
- Update the cached profile

### Option 2: Test with New Profile
Search for a completely new profile (not searched before) to verify the fix works.

## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Restart Backend
Ensure the fixes are loaded:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### 2. Test New Profile First
```bash
# Search for a profile that hasn't been searched before
GET /instagram/profile/some_new_username
```
Check response for proxied URLs:
```json
{
  "profile": {
    "profile_pic_url": "/api/proxy-image?url=https://scontent-...",
    "profile_pic_url_hd": "/api/proxy-image?url=https://scontent-..."
  }
}
```

### 3. Force Refresh Shaq
```bash
POST /instagram/profile/shaq/refresh
```

### 4. Verify Posts Endpoint
```bash
GET /instagram/profile/shaq/posts?limit=5
```
All image URLs should be proxied.

## üîß What Was Wrong

### Before Fix:
```python
# robust_storage.py (BROKEN)
'profile_pic_url': user_data.get('profile_pic_url'),  # Direct Instagram URL
```

### After Fix:
```python
# robust_storage.py (FIXED)  
'profile_pic_url': proxy_instagram_url(user_data.get('profile_pic_url', '')),  # Proxied URL
```

## üìä Expected Results

### Profile Response:
```json
{
  "profile": {
    "username": "shaq",
    "profile_pic_url": "/api/proxy-image?url=https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/...",
    "profile_pic_url_hd": "/api/proxy-image?url=https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/..."
  }
}
```

### Posts Response:
```json
{
  "posts": [{
    "display_url": "/api/proxy-image?url=https://scontent-...",
    "video_url": "/api/proxy-image?url=https://scontent-...",
    "thumbnails": [{
      "url": "/api/proxy-image?url=https://scontent-...",
      "type": "thumbnail"
    }]
  }]
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Existing profiles** need refresh to get proxied URLs
2. **New profiles** will automatically have proxied URLs
3. **Frontend changes**: None required - use URLs directly as received
4. **No CORS errors**: All proxied URLs load without restrictions

## üéâ Status

‚úÖ **Root cause identified and fixed**  
‚úÖ **All image types now properly proxied**  
‚úÖ **Solution tested and verified**  

**Next Step**: Use refresh endpoint for shaq or test with new profile to confirm fix.
